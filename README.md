# js_fizzbuzz

## What is this?
A simple FizzBuzz game with a number input and an unordered list showing all numbers from 1 to the inputed number.

Instead of a number it will print **Fizz** if the number is divisible by 3, **Buzz** if it is divisible by 5 and **FizzBuzz** if it is divisible by 3 and 5.
